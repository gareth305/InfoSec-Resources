# Resources
Infosec resources, collected from many different sources. I've personally found these resources helpful and/or interesting. So, have added them to this document for myself and others to make use of. (Resources I've used to help further my journey in infosec. So mainly aimed at the newer hackers, but the veteran hackers might find something useful as well.)

# Blogs

I've had a few interviews in the past where they've asked if I follow any blogs, so having a few to talk about is always useful and you learn at the same time!

* [GracefulSecurity](https://www.gracefulsecurity.com/) - Holly's approach, to blog writing, is second to none! Definitely worth adding to your bookmarks!
* [ZeroSec](https://blog.zsec.uk/) - Definitely a must read for those just starting out! Andy's blog is probably the most beginner friendly I've ever seen. He's even published a book, I'll mention it again down below but, [Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec).


# Twitter Accounts/People

Just accounts that I follow, there's plenty more to be found. Often they'll post '#FF', Follow Friday, another way to find more amazing accounts! Although you might think to yourself "I don't use twitter, I don't need it" it's worth it. Often the first place to learn of big hacks, and new vulnerabilities, and it's free... Just make an account, and see where it goes, you don't have to post anything.

* [@LargeCardinal](https://twitter.com/LargeCardinal) - Wow! Mark's probably the most knowledgable guy I know. He's definitely a must follow!
* [@HollyGraceful](https://twitter.com/HollyGraceful) - Her account, like her blog (GracefulSecurity), is full of knowledge and definitely worth a follow.
* [@ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish) - Andy is so down to earth and helpful! He often posts about his blog and book, so you won't miss any updates.
