# Resources
Infosec resources, collected from many different sources. I've personally found these resources helpful and/or interesting. So, have added them to this document for myself and others to make use of. (Resources I've used to help further my journey in infosec. So mainly aimed at the newer hackers, but the veteran hackers might find something useful as well.)

# CTFs

* [Captf.com](http://captf.com/practice-ctf/) - Extensive list of CTFs available online and to download.

# Blogs

I've had a few interviews in the past where they've asked if I follow any blogs, so having a few to talk about is always useful and you learn at the same time!

* [GracefulSecurity](https://www.gracefulsecurity.com/) - Holly's approach, to blog writing, is second to none! Definitely worth adding to your bookmarks!
* [ZeroSec](https://blog.zsec.uk/) - Definitely a must read for those just starting out! Andy's blog is probably the most beginner friendly I've ever seen. He's even published a book, I'll mention it again down below but, [Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec).
* [AppSecBloke](https://appsecbloke.com/) - Mixing learning with conference writeups, Mike's blog is another great one to add to the list!


# Twitter Accounts/People

Just accounts that I follow, there's plenty more to be found. Often they'll post '#FF', Follow Friday, another way to find more amazing accounts! Although you might think to yourself "I don't use twitter, I don't need it" it's worth it. Often the first place to learn of big hacks, and new vulnerabilities, and it's free... Just make an account, and see where it goes, you don't have to post anything.

* [@LargeCardinal](https://twitter.com/LargeCardinal) - Wow! Mark's probably the most knowledgable guy I know. He's definitely a must follow!
* [@HollyGraceful](https://twitter.com/HollyGraceful) - Her account, like her blog (GracefulSecurity), is full of knowledge and definitely worth a follow.
* [@ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish) - Andy is so down to earth and helpful! He often posts about his blog and book, so you won't miss any updates.
* [@Ministraitor](https://twitter.com/Ministraitor) - Cooper, Cooper is a one of a kind (in a good way!). He's the resident conference videographer. You'll find him and most conferences, and the ones you can't make it to? Oh, he'll already have uploaded the videos by the end of the day, usually!
  - [TBH by this point I gave up thinking of a description of each one... But they're all equally as amazing!]

### Students ###

# Societies/Groups/Gatherings/Gaggles

# Videos
### Sites ###
* [administraitor.video](https://administraitor.video/) - Does the name ring any bells? Cooper's videos not only get uploaded the conference's YouTube channels, but also to his website. Meaning they're all in one place, making it easy to watch one after another and, before you know it, it's 7am and your alarm's going off...

### YouTube Channels ###

# Gits

# Books

# Conferences
Conferences are a great way to meet people! Yes it may be scary at first, but we're all nice people really... Well most of us are! Ask questions, talk about your projects and get advice, and learn about other people's projects it can often give you a great idea to add to your, already long, list!

### BSides ###
They're everywhere! I guarantee if you Google your town and BSides, there'll be one there or if not it won't be too far away!

* [BSides Leeds](http://bsidesleeds.co.uk/) | [@BSidesLeeds](https://twitter.com/BSidesLeeds) - Obviously the best one! Not that I'm bias or anything... ;) 
* [BSides Manchester](https://www.bsidesmcr.org.uk/) | [@BSidesMCR](https://twitter.com/BSidesMCR)

Just to name a couple, obviously there's plenty more!

* [SteelCon](https://www.steelcon.info/) | [@Steel_Con](https://twitter.com/Steel_Con) - A bit more expensive than the other two, but 100% worth it! All the money from tickets goes straight back into the conference. From swag bags to other stuff, I tend to pay the most attention to the swag bags!

* [Securi-Tay](https://securi-tay.co.uk/) | [@AbertayHackers](https://twitter.com/AbertayHackers) - Unfortunately, there's no Taylor Swift just cold weather... A student run conference in Dundee (Scotland), great for those still finding their feet. Just a forewarning, you'll likely hear legal tender mentioned, alot.

There's so many more! [Cybersecurity Conferences](https://infosec-conferences.com/) is a great website to see what's coming up.
